This command works exactly like `EXPIRE` but the time to live of the key is
specified in milliseconds instead of seconds.

## Options

The `PEXPIRE` command supports a set of options

* `NX` -- Set expiry only when the key has no expiry
* `XX` -- Set expiry only when the key has an existing expiry
* `GT` -- Set expiry only when the new expiry is greater than current one
* `LT` -- Set expiry only when the new expiry is less than current one

A non-volatile key is treated as an infinite TTL for the purpose of `GT` and `LT`.
The `GT`, `LT` and `NX` options are mutually exclusive.

@examples

```cli
SET mykey "Hello"
PEXPIRE mykey 1500
TTL mykey
PTTL mykey
PEXPIRE mykey 1000 XX
TTL mykey
PEXPIRE mykey 1000 NX
TTL mykey
```
